# Hi there üëã I'm Cristian Asprilla!

Welcome to my corner of GitHub! I'm a passionate and driven Data Scientist and Developer with a strong focus on transforming complex data into clear, actionable insights through powerful visualizations and building robust, data-driven applications. I thrive on exploring new technologies and leveraging code to solve real-world challenges.

### üöÄ What I'm passionate about & exploring

My primary interests and areas of focus include:

- Data Science & Visualization: Harnessing data to uncover patterns, build predictive models, and communicate findings effectively through compelling visual narratives.

- Machine Learning: Exploring and implementing various ML algorithms to extract value from data.

- Data Engineering: Designing and building pipelines to collect, process, and store large datasets.

- Full-Stack Development: Building scalable, secure, and user-friendly web applications, often with a data-centric backend.

### üõ†Ô∏è My Toolkit & Skills

Here's a glimpse into the technologies and tools I frequently work with:

- Languages: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn), R (ggplot2, dplyr), SQL, Java, JavaScript

- Data Analysis & Visualization: Jupyter Notebooks, RStudio, Tableau (if applicable), Matplotlib, Seaborn, ggplot2, interactive dashboards

- Frameworks/Libraries: Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, Bootstrap

- Databases: PostgreSQL

- Tools & Platforms: Git, GitHub, Docker

- Concepts: Statistical Modeling, Predictive Analytics, RESTful APIs, Object-Oriented Programming, Data Structures & Algorithms

### üí° Featured Projects

Take a look at some of my recent work that highlights my capabilities, with a focus on data science:

* #### [Panama Presidential Elections Visualisation Report 2024](https://github.com/CristianAsprilla/Panama-Presidential-Elections-Visualisation-Report-2024)
  
  A comprehensive data visualization and analysis project of the 2024 Panama Presidential Elections, exploring voting patterns, regional distributions, and electoral dynamics through interactive R-based visualizations. Data is sourced from the Tribunal Electoral de Panam√°.
  
* #### [Hotel Management System](https://github.com/CristianAsprilla/Hotel-Management-System)

  A full-stack Hotel Management System built with Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, and PostgreSQL. This system features secure authentication, robust customer and room management, a flexible booking system, and efficient service management. While not my core data science focus, it demonstrates my full-stack development capabilities.
